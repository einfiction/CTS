# Combined Theoretical Signal (CTS)

The Combined Theoretical Signal (CTS) model integrates influences from dark matter, quantum fluctuations, and higher-dimensional effects, providing a potential framework for unifying gravity and quantum physics. This repository contains the data, code, and documentation related to the CTS model.

## Description
The CTS model aims to validate theoretical predictions against observational gravitational wave data. It includes:
- Mathematical equations and derivations
- Data processing and analysis scripts
- Generated signals and comparisons
- Residual analysis and statistical validation

## Repository Contents
- `data/`: HDF5 files with gravitational wave data
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data processing and analysis
- `docs/`: Documentation and supplementary materials
